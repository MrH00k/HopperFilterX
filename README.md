# HopperFilterX

A lightweight, multilingual Minecraft plugin that lets you filter what hoppers can pick up using a simple in-game GUI. Designed for performance, survival, and technical servers.

## 🔧 Features

- `/hopper give <player> [amount]`: Give special filter-enabled hoppers to players.
- `/hopper remove <player> <uuid>`: Remove a filtered hopper from a player or the world.
- `/hopper list <player>`: List all filtered hoppers owned by a player.
- `/hopper addperm <player> <uuid>`: Grant players access to your filtered hoppers.
- `/hopper removeperm <player> <uuid>`: Remove player access from your filtered hoppers.
- `/hopper reload`: Reload the plugin's configuration and language files.
- 🔍 **Filter System**: Shift + right-click a HopperFilterX hopper to open a GUI.
- 📥 **Drag and Drop Items**: Insert any items into the GUI to define the hopper’s filter.
- ✅ **Selective Item Movement**: Hopper will only move items matching the filter.
- 🔄 **Fallback Behavior**: If no filter is defined, it behaves like a regular vanilla hopper.

- 🗃️ **Persistent Filters**: Filter settings are saved and restored even after server restarts.
- 🛡️ **Owner Protection**: Only the owner can pick up or configure their filtered hoppers.

## 🎮 How it Works

1. Use `/hopper give <player> [amount]` to give a player a special hopper.
2. Place the hopper like any normal one.
3. **Shift + Right-Click** on it to open the filter GUI.
4. Add items you want the hopper to accept.
5. The hopper will now only move the selected items. If the filter is empty, it works like vanilla.

## 🔗 Permission System

HopperFilterX includes a built-in permission system that allows you to share access to your filtered hoppers with other players:

- **Grant Access**: Use `/hopper addperm <player> <uuid>` to allow another player to use your filtered hoppers
  - Without UUID: Grants access to all your current and future filtered hoppers
  - With UUID: Grants access only to a specific hopper
- **Revoke Access**: Use `/hopper removeperm <player> <uuid>` to remove a player's access
- **Owner Protection**: Only the hopper owner can modify filters and manage permissions
- **Persistent**: Permissions are saved in the database and persist across server restarts

## 💡 Use Cases

- Create automated item sorters.
- Prevent specific items from being picked up in complex redstone systems.
- Set up refined farms and storage systems with ease.
